# Hello, I'm HIM
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Yo, what's up my fellow game warriors! You know, if cracking games were a sport, I'd have more trophies than an esports team, no cap. Cybersec? Oh, bro, don't even get me started. I can hack my way into the matrix faster than you can say "password123". That's the first thing they teach you, by the way don't use "password123," my dude. But hey, who am I to judge? It's 2025, and half of you still have your dog’s name as your password. "Fluffy2012," anyone?

When I'm not out there pwning noobs or making my system more secure than Fort Knox, you can find me running around in games, probably with a sniper rifle, getting headshots like it's nothing unless I’m playing against my buddies, in which case, I’ll be the one eating dirt because they’ve got my number on speed dial.

But seriously, man, if you want to talk cyberpunk, Red Team vs Blue Team, or anything involving breaking into firewalls and having a laugh at the same time, I’m your guy. Oh, and the number one rule of gaming: NEVER trust a guy with a username like "ProGamer_69"—they're either too good or too weird. Either way, it’s suspicious. 👀

Also, PSA: if you’re downloading cracked games, make sure you’re not getting hit with more viruses than the latest "Call of Duty" patch. Believe me, bro, one bad crack and your PC is like a public server everyone’s got access. Not the good kind of access, though. We're talking "get-your-wallet-hacked" kind of access.


## Objective
To write code so clean that even my coffee needs a break, crack games (the legal way, of course), and secure systems like I’m guarding the crown jewels while simultaneously questioning why my Wi-Fi always decides to fail during critical moments. Aiming to make coding fun, debugging less painful, and building projects that maybe don’t have bugs (but let’s be real, probably do). Always looking for cool collaborations, and if you bring memes to the table, you’re already winning.


## Skills
**Full Stack Development: **Can build both the front end and back end of a project, and still have enough energy to explain it to you in 3 different ways.

**Cybersecurity**: Securing systems with the precision of a ninja but without the throwing stars (unless we're talking code).

**Game Hacking & Modding**: Legally unlocking game content and diving deep into code to break—uh, I mean, improve game mechanics.

**Cloud Computing:** Making sure your data is as secure as Fort Knox, but with a lot more coffee involved.

**Database Management**: I handle databases like I handle my snacks organized, well-structured, and maybe a little too much.

**Bug Debugging:** Finding bugs faster than you can say "error 404." I can break a system and fix it in under 5 minutes (probably with a few memes in between).

**Wi-Fi Whisperer**: Can get the Wi-Fi working again just by looking at the router (no guarantees, though).

**Game Glitch Expert**: Able to find and exploit every game glitch, sometimes accidentally, but always hilariously.

**Password Cracking **(The Ethical Kind): I break passwords, but only the ones I’ve forgotten.

**Procrastination**: Expert in putting off tasks, but always delivers just before the deadline like some sort of code-fueled miracle.


## Tools
**Git & GitHub** – My version control game is strong. If only I could use Git to control my life.

**Docker**– Containerizing everything from apps to my procrastination.

**Kali Linux** – The hacker's Swiss Army knife; I promise, I use it responsibly.

**VS Code** – My code editor of choice. I would marry it if it wasn’t just a software.

**AWS & Azure** – Scaling the cloud like it’s my second home.

**Postman** – Testing APIs faster than I can debug them (which, let's be real, is pretty fast).

**SQL & NoSQL Databases**– Whether it's structured or unstructured, I’ll query it like a pro.

**Terraform** – Infrastructure as code, because manually setting things up is so 2010.

**Google** – My most reliable tool, also known as "Google It," the solution to all problems.

**Coffee** – I swear, I’d be 50% less productive without this magical productivity tool.

**Notepad++**– Because sometimes you need a tool that just gets you, even if it's not the most sophisticated.

**Ctrl+Z**– The most used shortcut in my life; if I could “undo” my mistakes in real life, I’d be a millionaire.

**Task Manager** – When all else fails, I turn to this tool to see if my PC’s slow because it’s overwhelmed or because I have 27 tabs open.

**"Stack Overflow"** – My co-developer, debugger, and unofficial therapist.

**Google Chrome Developer Tools** – Inspecting websites like it’s my full-time job (and sometimes, it is).

## Projects
**_Personal Portfolio Website_** – Built from scratch with a responsive design to showcase my skills, experience, and maybe a few memes if you look closely.

**_Custom Security Tool_** – A tool for penetration testing, network monitoring, or vulnerability scanning, because I’m all about keeping things secure... and fun.

**_Game Modding Framework_** – A framework to enhance or modify popular games without breaking the game’s TOS (totally legit, of course).

**_Cloud-Based To-Do App_** – Developed a full-stack to-do app using AWS or Azure for cloud hosting and Firebase for real-time sync.

**_Data Analysis Tool_** – A Python-based tool that scrapes data, cleans it up, and spits out some neat graphs (because who doesn’t love data visualizations?).

**_404 Error Page Generator_** – A tool to create hilarious 404 error pages, because who needs a boring "Page Not Found" when you can have a dancing cat?

**_Procrastination Timer_** – A Chrome extension that tracks how much time you waste on the internet and then sends you motivational quotes to make you feel bad about it.

**_Coffee Tracker App_** – An app that tracks how much coffee you drink per day and gives you warnings when you're about to cross the "too much" line. (Spoiler: It’s always too much.)

**_Wi-Fi Password Strength Meter_** – A tool to analyze how strong your Wi-Fi password is... and maybe give you suggestions to stop using “password123.”

"**_Make Me a Sandwich" Bot_** – A chatbot that responds to any command with "Make me a sandwich," because why not.

**_Gamer Rage Counter_** – A web app that counts how many times you yell at your screen during gaming sessions. It tracks stats like "Number of F-bombs dropped" and "Tears shed."
